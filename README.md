# Dotfiles Repository
Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Dotfiles are configuration files and settings for various software applications and tools that personalize and enhance my development environment.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to help automate the configuration of dot files whenever a new instance of a Linux distribution is used. These configurations are for commonly used programs such as terminal emulators and editors such as neovim. Additionally there are configurations for programs such as window managers. 

## Disclaimer
Use at your own risk. These dotfiles are tailored to my personal preferences and workflows. While you're welcome to use them as a starting point, I recommend reviewing and customizing them to align with your needs.
